    "\n",
    "The SIR simulation interprets the centrality measure of a node as an estimate of the node's ability to spread diseases. In the model, a node can be in three different states:\n",
    "- (S) susceptible,\n",
    "- (I) infected, and\n",
    "- (R) recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, every node in the graph is susceptible. The algorithm starts by infecting a random \"seed\" node. In each time step, there is a certain probability for a susceptible node to be infected, if it is connected to an infected node. In the same step, there is a probability, that an infected node recovers. Recovered nodes are immune and can not be infected again. The infection spreads until no node is infected anymore. After that, the number of recovered nodes in the graph is counted and the resulting value is assigned to the nodes as a centrality measure. Since the result is kind of random, it makes sense to repeat the simulation multiple times to receive an average. This can also be done on the WebOCD service.\n",

    "The Random Package Transmission simulates the process of sending a package from a source node *s* to a target node *t*. At every node between s and t, the package randomly chooses an edge to follow. For unweighted graphs, all edges have the same probability. In weighted graphs, the probability of an edge is proportional to its weight. The simulation ends when the package reaches the target node t. For every node, the number of times it was reached by the package is assigned as the centrality measure."
