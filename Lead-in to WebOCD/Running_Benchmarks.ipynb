    "### The LFR Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lancichinetti–Fortunato–Radicchi (LFR) Benchmark is an algorithm for benchmark network generation. Benchmark networks are artificial networks that resemble real-world networks. Benchmark algorithms are meant for comparing and testing different community detection algorithms because the created synthethic data already has a priori communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the algorithms and a detailed description, check the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4770).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following list explains the parameters of the LFR Benchmark algorithm in WebOCD that are modifiable by the users. The parameter descriptions are taken from the implementation in WebOCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- n - The nodecount of the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- k - The average node degree of the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- maxk - The maximum node degree of the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- mut - The topological mixing parameter which determines how many edges a node shares with nodes of other communities\n",
    "- muw - The weight mixing parameter for the community-internal strengths of nodes\n",
    "- beta - The exponent for the probability distribution of the total strengths of nodes\n",
    "- t1 - The exponent for the probability distribution of the node degrees\n",
    "- t2 - The exponent for the probability distribution of community sizes\n",
    "- minc - The minimum community size of the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- maxc - The maximum community size of the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- on - The number of overlapping nodes in the benchmark graphs\n",
    "- om - The number of communities an overlapping node belongs to\n",
    "\n",
    "All presented parameters have default values in WebOCD. Anyways, in most cases the modification of the parameters is highly recommended to fit  ones specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the parameters, the user needs to specify a name for the graph that is created as well as the corresponding cover. Clicking on Run Benchmark executes the algorithm with the specified parameters. The user is redirected to a table that contains the created cover and graph. These can also be reached through the corresponding tables."

    "### Signed LFR Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "The signed LFR Benchmark algorithm is based on the LFR Benchmark algorithm above. Instead of working on directed and undirected graphs, this algorithm works on signed and directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses the same parameters as above and adds the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- neg - The fraction of intra-edges which are negative\n",
    "- pos - The fraction of inter-edges which are positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Except the additional parameters, using the Signed LFR Benchmark algorithm is similar to using the normal LFR Benchmark algorithm."
