    "# Run Centrality Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are representations of relationships between entities, like karate club members for our Zachary Karate Club dataset. These members are represented as nodes, and their interactivity outside the normal club activities is represented using edges. Some of these members or nodes in the graph might be more important than others. Centrality is used to measure this importance. Therefore, the definition of importance can change which nodes in the graph are actually important. The huge number of different existing centrality measures defines the importance of nodes from different perspectives. Calculating the centrality of a graph provides important analytical information about it and its nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the list of centrality measures in the WebOCD service is very long, this notebook will cover only a few of them in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a centrality calculation in the web service, the user needs to select a graph. In the graph overview, the centrality measures can be found in the *Run Centrality Calculation* collabsable. The user can select an arbitrary centrality measure and click on *Run*.\n",

    "Clicking on the *Centralities* tab shows a list of all the centralities that were calculated for the selected graph. Choosig a specific centrality shows the centrality overview where the user can take a look at the specific centrality values, the parameters, and the visualization of the graph with centrality values.

    "The PageRank (PR) algorithm is normally used to rank the importance of web pages for search engines. Therefore, it counts the number and quality of links to a certain page. The quality of a link is determined by the quality of the page, the link comes from. The underlying assumption of the algorithm is that important pages are much more likely to receive more links from other pages."
