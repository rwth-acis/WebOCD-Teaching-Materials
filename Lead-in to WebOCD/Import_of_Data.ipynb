    "### Import of Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using the WebOCD service, one needs a network graph on which the algorithms can be executed. There are two possible ways on adding a network graph to WebOCD. The user can either import an existing graph into WebOCD which will be covered in this notebook. The other way would be to create a synthetic graph using one of the benchmark algorithms for synthtic network creation which are provided by the WebOCD service as well. This step will be covered in another notebook on [Running Benchmark Algorithms](Running_Benchmarks.ipynb) of this lead-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The form for graph imports in the WebOCD web service looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/importGraphForm.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach the showed form, users can simply press the *Import* button in the upper right corner of the WebOCD web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing to import a graph, the user can choose between a variety of different graph formats. These different formats will be further explained in the course of this document. After choosing the right format for the data, the user needs to upload the corresponding file. Now, the user can specify a name for the uploaded network graph. The last dropdown menu enables the user to choose between different creation methods for the graph. This information is just for the user to differentiate between multiple graphs with identical names. Therefore, the user can choose between the creation methods:\n",
    "- *Undefined* - in case the method is not known,\n",
    "- *Real World* - if the dataset was created using real world data,\n",
    "- *Newman* - if the graph was created using the Newman benchmark,\n",
    "- *LFR* - if the graph was created using the LFR benchmark, and\n",
    "- *Signed LFR* - if the network graph was created using the signed LFR benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the form, the user also is able to click the *make undirected* checkbox that transforms every graph into an undirected graph, which has influence on some of the usable algorithms in the service. Clicking the *Submit* button creates the graph in WebOCD and shows it in the *Networks* list of the web service. This list looks as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/networksList.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "and provides a lot of information about the available graphs. Besides showing the chosen name of the graph, the number of nodes and the number of edges, the list also indicates for every graph if it is\n",
    "- *directed (D)* - if the corresponding graph contains directed edges,\n",
    "- *weighted (W)* - if the corresponding graph contains weighted edges,\n",
    "- *zero weight (Z)* - if the graph has zero edge weights,\n",
    "- *negative weight (N)* - if the graph has negative weighted edges, and\n",
    "- *self loops (L)* - if the corresponnding graph contains self loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the user has the opportunity to see the covers of the graphs, the centralities of the graphs, and the cooperation simulations of the graphs. The last column of the networks list provides the opportunity to delete a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GraphML\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphML is a file format for graphs that is absed on XML. It supports nearly the entire range of graph structure constellations like directed, undirected, and mixed graphs. The file contains a `graph` element. Within this element, there is an unordered sequence of `node` and `edge` elements. For every `node` element, there needs to be a distinct `id` . Every `edge` element needs a `source` and a `target` attribute. The format also provides the possibility to associate additional data with the containing nodes and edges. A simple GraphML file could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<graphml xmlns=\"http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns\"  \n",
    "    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n",
    "    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd\">\n",
    "  <graph id=\"Graph\" edgedefault=\"undirected\">\n",
    "    <node id=\"node0\"/>\n",
    "    <node id=\"node1\"/>\n",
    "    <edge id=\"edge1\" source=\"node0\" target=\"node1\"/>\n",
    "  </graph>\n",
    "</graphml>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edge Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge lists are datstructures for graph representation that simply is a list of all edges of the graph. Therefore, an unweighted edge in the list is represented by two numbers, the source and the target of the edge. An weighted edge would be represented using three numbers. So the whole list could be represented using a two or three column matrix. Besides weighted and unweighted lists, in WebOCD users also can import graphs as node weighted edge lists and node content edge lists. Node weighted edge lists contain the weight of the node instead of the edge, while node content edge lists are lists of nodes that contain either an author attribute, a content attribute and a threadid attribute or a sender attribute which is used as the username as well, a receiver attribute and a content attribute in every line. The structure of node weighted edge lists starts with one node name per line and continues with the list of edges, one edge per line that is target node, source node, edge weight. The first line of the document needs to specify the attribute names. For example, an unweighted edge list in JavaScript could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const edgeList = [\n",
    "  [1,2],\n",
    "  [2,3],\n",
    "  [3,1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GML\n",
    "\n",
    "GML is the short form for Graph Modelling Language or Graph Meta Language. It is an hierarchical ASCII-based file format used to describe graphs. A simple GML file could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "graph [\n",
    "\tcomment \"Simple network graph\"\n",
    "\tdirected 1\n",
    "\tid 42\n",

    "#### XML\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a well known and widely used file format for storing and transmitting data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a way, that is understandable by humans and machines. The goal of XML is simplicity, generality, and usability all across the internet. As already seen in the GraphML section, XML is capable of representing graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XGMML\n",
    "\n",
    "The Extensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language (XGMML) is an application of XML which is based on GML and used for graph representation. It is designed in a way that it can be easily converted to XML. A XGMML file could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE graph PUBLIC \"\" \"\">\n",
    "<graph directed=\"1\" id=\"42\" label=\"graph\">\n",

    "</graph>\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "For a graph G=(n,p) an adjacency matrix is a square matrix of size n that represents a finite graph. It indicates whether two nodes in the graph are adjacent or not. For a simple graph, the matrix is a (0,1)-matrix, that has zeros on its diagonal. If the represented graph is undirected, the matrix also is symmetric. If the graph is weighted, the entry (i,j) with value k indicates and edge weight of k of the edge from node i to node j in the corresponding graph. An adjacency matrix for a simple, undirected, and unweighted graph could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A = [\n",
    "\t[0,1,1],\n",
    "\t[1,0,1],\n",

    "#### Community Member List\n",
    "\n",
    "Community Member Lists accepted by the WebOCD service are of a specific structure. Each line of the file starts with an optional name of the community which is followed by the names of all member nodes that are seperated using the space character (' '). For every node in a corresponding community, the membership degree is equal. For example, a Community Member List could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "community1 node1 node2 node3\n",

A viable file has exactly one node in every line an the same number n of double values. A file could look like this:\n",
